# Winnipeg Weather Website

I am interested in looking at the climate in Winnipeg, so I used React.js to build the website.

## How to start this project?

Make sure that you have the node.js lts version on your computer, and then run the following command:

```shell
npm install
```

After that, type `npm start`; The browser should open a new webpage (`http://localhost:3000`).

## Backend

I have also built the backend using Deta, and the repository is [Winnipeg-climate-Backend](https://github.com/calpa/Winnipeg-climate-Backend).
